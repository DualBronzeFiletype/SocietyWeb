Making a website for my school's society

If you want to link files to the html you need to add the https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/ before it so github would recognise where it is

For example:
```
<image src="https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/src/images/cat.png" /><br />
```
