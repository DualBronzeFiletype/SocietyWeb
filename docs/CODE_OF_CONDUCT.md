# CODE RULE

If you want to link files to the html you need to add the `https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/` before it so github would recognise where it is
For example:

```html
<image src="https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/src/images/cat.png" /><br />
```

The output would look like this:
![image](https://github.com/DualBronzeFiletype/SocietyWeb/blob/ab925d20909eb9409b26682fb334c272c8b54295/src/images/output.png?raw=true)

Also please use tabs instead of spaces so your nad others ide or light editor can format it to your's and others liking.

If the website won't make changes after updating, consider clearing your browser cache. There are however other problems that may lead to this and cannot simply fix it that easily.
