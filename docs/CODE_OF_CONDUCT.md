# CODE RULE
Please use tabs instead of spaces so your nad others ide or light editor can format it to your's and others liking.

If the website won't make changes after updating, consider clearing your browser cache or pressing F5 on your keyboard to force refresh without cache. There are however other problems that may lead to this and cannot simply fix it that easily.

A line of code and text should not exceed to the point where most people needs to scroll sideways or zoom out to see all of the content, ever heard of the enter key?

Avoid using .md files if you want a subpage, please use the .html file instead
