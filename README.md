Making a website for my school's society

If you want to link files to the html you need to add the https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/ before it so github would recognise where it is

For example:
```
<image src="https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/src/images/cat.png" /><br />
```
It should look like this:

#### I have no idea how to tell github to ignore some files when merging but that seems impossible after searching for like idk 2 hours so instead create a branch from this and merge using the new branch before deleting it
