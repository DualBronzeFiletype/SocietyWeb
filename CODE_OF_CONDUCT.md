# CODE RULE
If you want to link files to the html you need to add the https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/ before it so github would recognise where it is
For example:
```
<image src="https://dualbronzefiletype.github.io/SocietyWeb/src/images/cat.png" /><br />
```
The output would look like this:
![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DualBronzeFiletype/SocietyWeb/alpha/src/images/output.png)

Also please use tabs instead of spaces so your nad others ide or light editor can format it to your's and others liking.
